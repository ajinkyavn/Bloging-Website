# Bloging-Website
Users can create account and post blogs.
They can also view blogs of other users and like them.
Blogs are classified into various categories and user can select to view their preferred category.

The Front-End is inspired from Twitter(X) and created using ReactJs.
The Back-End is created using NodeJs Express and REST api.

For database we have used MongoDB and some cloud services.

# To run project locally.
You will make the changes to the mongo and other credentials according to your credentials.

Once all configurations are done successfully run these commands.
```bash
cd backend
nodemon index
```
Once the backend is up and running, open a new terminal change folder to front end and run the program.

```bash
cd ..
cd frontend
npm start
```

This will start the website on localhost. 
Open the website on any browser by typing the localhost address.
